pastpages.org was a news homepage archived created by Ben Welsh in 2012.

Funded by a [successful Kickstarter campaign](https://web.archive.org/web/20180325233631/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/651552740/keep-pastpages-alive?ref=live), it preserved roughly 3.5 million screenshots from 2012 to 2018.

Most of those images are now stored in a permanent collection of [at the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/pastpages?sort=-publicdate). The original website has been retired.
